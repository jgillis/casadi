  min          1/2 x' H x + g' x 
   x
  
  subject to
              1/2 x' Pi x  +  qi' x + ri  <= 0   for i=0..nq-1             
              LBA <= A x <= UBA
              LBX <= x   <= UBX
              
      with :
        H, Pi sparse (n x n) positive definite
        g, qi dense  (n x 1)
        ri scalar
              
      n: number of decision variables (x)
      nc: number of linear constraints (A)
      nq: number of quadratic constraints
      
  \endverbatim
  
  If H, Pi is not positive-definite, the solver should throw an error.
